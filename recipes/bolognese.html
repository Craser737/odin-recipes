      <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>5-6 slices of smoked bacon</li>
      <li>2 medium onions</li>
      <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
      <li>3 carrots</li>
      <li>3 celery stalks</li>
      <li>2 heaped tsp dried oregano</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>small bunch of fresh basil</li>
      <li>500g lean ground beef</li>
      <li>500g ground port</li>
      <li>28 oz can of San Marzano tomatoes</li>
      <li>4 oz parmesan cheese, grated</li>
      <li>4 oz tomato paste</li>
      <li>splash of balsamic</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>peel and finely chop onions, carrots, and celery stalks. Mince garlic, 
        and grate parmesan cheese. Pick basil leaves.</li>
      <li>Slice bacon.</li>
      <li>In a large pot on medium high heat, add olive oil, bacon, and oregano. 
        Saute 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add onion. Continue to cook,stirring occasionally until onion begins to turn 
        translucent and bacon is lightly golden (about 5 minutes.)</li>
      <li>Add ground meat, carrots, and celery. Break up meat as you stir, cooking for 
        an additional 5-7 minutes or until vegetables soften slightly.</li>
      <li>Toss in San Marzano tomatoes, tomato paste, and a healthy pinch of salt and 
        pepper. Once sauce starts to boil, reduce temperature and cook covered at a low simmer 
        for 1 hour. Remove lid and continue to simmer for  an additional 30 minutes. Add a splash of water if 
        sauce appears too thick.</li>
      <li>Remove from heat. Add half the parmesan, a splash of balsamic, and stir in the basil. 
        Have a taste and adjust salt and pepper as required.</li>
      <li>ladle sauce on your clan's favorite noodle, and top with remainder of Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
